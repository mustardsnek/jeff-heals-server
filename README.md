## About

This repo is an example/use case of Keystone.js with a specific focus on custom component blocks that can be manipulated by an end user to change/populate react components on the frontend. This specific project is talked more about here https://www.vesslio.com/services/website. It's functionality is additional leveraged when paired with a corporate component library via storybook so that consistency can be guaranteed (and code redundancy reduced) between the admin component version and the frontend user version. 

## Future

Keystone is a great tool for this kind of CMS customization. This repo may be updated if I find another use case or want to add additional admin customization.
